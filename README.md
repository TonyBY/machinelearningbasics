Introductory Machine Learning in Python (for tutorial pdf visit suwangcompling.com).

# Note on Code
The code is written in a verbose fashion such that each step is explicitly and clearly demonstrated, in correspondence to the tutorial. (For ''fancier'' code that comes with visualization and coding optimization, consult other blogs/github contributors. The current implementation only aims to make clear the main ideas covered in the tutorial.)  
Being a linguist, most likely my implementation is not entirely satisfactory. Critical comments are warmly welcome!  

# Usage
Usage examples are included at the end of .py files.
