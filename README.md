# machinelearningbasics

## A. Real Basics (ch1-ch6 indexed. simplest code with Numpy from scratch)

* **Tutorial:** Introductory Machine Learning in Python (for tutorial pdf visit suwangcompling.com).
* Note: The code is written in a verbose fashion such that each step is explicitly and clearly demonstrated, in correspondence to the tutorial. (For ''fancier'' code that comes with visualization and coding optimization, consult other blogs/github contributors. The current implementation only aims to make clear the main ideas covered in the tutorial.)  
Being a linguist, most likely my implementation is not entirely satisfactory. Critical comments are warmly welcome!
